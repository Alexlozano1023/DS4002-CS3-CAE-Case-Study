# Supplemental Materials for CAE Turbulence Case Study

This folder contains two readings that support the case study **Reconstructing Turbulence Fields Using Convolutional Autoencoders**. These materials provide the conceptual and technical background needed to understand how autoencoders work and why they are useful for reconstructing turbulence data.

## 1. Conceptual Explainer (Beginner-Friendly)
**Title:** An Introduction to Autoencoders (Analytics Vidhya)  
**Link:** https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/10/an-introduction-to-autoencoders/

This is a blog-style, accessible introduction to autoencoders.  
It explains:
- What autoencoders are  
- How they compress and reconstruct data  
- Why they are useful in practical applications  

**When to read it:**  
Before starting the notebook.  
This resource builds intuition and prepares you for the hands-on part of the case study.

## 2. Technical Article (Deeper Theory)
**Title:** An Introduction to Autoencoders – Umberto Michelucci  
**PDF Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.03898.pdf  
**Abstract Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03898

This is a more technical, academic overview of autoencoders.  
It covers:
- Reconstruction error  
- Loss functions  
- Model structure  
- Real-world applications  

**When to read it:**  
After or while completing the notebook.  
This resource helps you connect the practical implementation with the deeper theoretical ideas behind CAEs.

## How to Use These Materials
- Use the **blog explainer** to understand the big picture before training your model.  
- Use the **technical article** to refine your understanding and support your written interpretation of results.  
- Both PDFs should be printed and included on the **right side of your manila folder**, as required by the CS3 rubric.
